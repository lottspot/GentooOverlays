		wpa_actiond is an Arch Linux project developed as an interface to wpa_ctrl, the wpa_supplicant C interface. wpa_actiond is used to handle automatic connect/disconnect events on wireless interfaces, and is leveraged in Arch's netcfg tool and the more modern netctl, which replaced it. netctl is available in gentoo's portage tree, and wpa_actiond is required in order to leverage netctl's netctl-auto.
